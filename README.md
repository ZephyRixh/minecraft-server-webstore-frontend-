# Official Store & Landing Page

Welcome to the official web repository for this modern store frontend. This project is a polished landing page and shopping experience designed for gaming communities and online stores.

## 🚀 Features

- **Immersive Hero Section:** Featuring animated particles, ghost text layers, and a one-click "Copy IP" system.
- **Interactive Store Preview:** A responsive sidebar-driven category system (Ranks, Coins, etc.) with staggered fade-in animations.
- **Visual Polish:**
  - **Scroll Reveal:** Smooth intersection-based reveal animations as you scroll.
  - **3D Card Tilt:** Subtle mouse-tracking tilt and glow effects on store packages and cards.
  - **Smooth Scrolling:** Seamless navigation between sections.
- **Custom Branding:** Integrated custom fonts (Ethnocentric & Epic Pro) and server-specific assets.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

### Local Development
1.  **Clone/Download:** Obtain the project files.
2.  **Run Preview:** Double-click `run-preview.bat` (Windows) or simply open `index.html` in your browser.
3.  **Customization:**
    - **Server IP:** Search for `ip-copy-value` in `index.html` to update the server address.
    - **Links:** Update Discord and Store links in the Hero and Welcome sections.
    - **Store Categories:** Modify the `switchStoreTab` function calls in `index.html` and the corresponding logic in `script.js`.

## 🎨 Design Notes

- **Colors:** Dominated by a dark theme with vibrant orange and red accents.
- **Typography:** Uses `Ethnocentric` for headers and `Epic Pro` for stylized elements.
- **Full Cross-Device Parity:** Navigation system and login features are fully consistent and functional across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices without compromise.
